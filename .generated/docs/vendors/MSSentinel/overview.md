## Flow nodes

### Orchestrate this vendor from TheHive Flow workflows

Work Sentinel incidents from TheHive Flow and maintain Sentinel watchlists.

**Example use cases:**

- Import Sentinel incidents with their entities as TheHive alerts and observables
- Write the TheHive analysis back as a comment on the Sentinel incident
- Close the Sentinel incident with the right classification when the case is closed

TheHive Flow is a first-party module that requires a TheHive One license.
